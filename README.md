Chrome_Clear_Cache
==================

<b><u>Batch file to clear Google-Chrome cache</b></u>

I was facing problems with omnibox/URL bar in Google-Chrome<br>
as it responded very slow to every key-stroke...<br>
After a bit of googling I found out that it was problem with cache of the browser..<br>

After saving this Batch file and then running it with <b>Administrator Rights</b> one can clear <br>
the Google-Chrome cache and continue with the awesomeness of the omnibox :)<br>

<b>Be Sure to replace %username% with your system-username</b><br>

<b>Happy Browsing :)</b>
