Chrome_Clear_Cache
==================

<b><u>Batch file to clear Google-Chrome cache</b></u>

I was facing problems with omnibox/URL bar in Google-Chrome
It responded very slow to every key-stroke...
After a bit of googling I found out that it was problem with cache of the browser..

After saving this Batch file and then running it with <b>Administrator Rights</b> one can clear 
the Google-Chrome cache and continue with the awesomeness of the omnibox :)

<b>Happy Browsing :)</b>
