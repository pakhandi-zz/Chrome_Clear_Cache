Chrome_Clear_Cache
==================

<b><u>Batch file to clear Google-Chrome cache</b></u>

<b><u>Compatibility checked on Windows-8,8.1</u></b>

I was facing problems with omnibox/URL bar in Google-Chrome<br>
as it responded very slowly to every key-stroke...<br>
After a bit of googling I found out that it was problem with cache of the browser..<br>

After saving this Batch file and then running it with <b>Administrator Rights</b> one can clear <br>
the Google-Chrome cache and continue with the awesomeness of the omnibox :)<br>

To save yourself the trouble of running it with administrator rights everytime, follow the following steps :<br>
<b>1> </b>Create a shortcut of the batch file. <br>
<b>2> </b>Right click on the shortcut-file and goto <i><b>properties</b></i>.<br>
<b>3> </b>In the <i><b>shortcut</b></i> tab, click on <i><b>advanced</b></i>.<br>
<b>4> </b>Check the <i><b>Run as Administrator</b></i> check box and click <i><b>OK</b></i>. <br>

Now, whenever your omnibox/URL bar starts getting slow, a simple double-click on this shortcut-file will solve the problem. :)<br>

<b><u>You can hard-code your system username in the batch file to avoid entering it everytime</u></b>

<b>Happy Browsing :)</b>
